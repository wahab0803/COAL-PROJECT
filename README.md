# COAL-PROJECT
This project is a Student Management System (SMS) built entirely in x86 Assembly Language using the Irvine32 library.
It was created as part of the COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course in the 3rd semester.

The system allows basic student record handling through simple, menu-driven interaction inside the console.
